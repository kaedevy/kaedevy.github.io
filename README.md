    <h1> My Reflection about Understanding HTML </h1>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p> HTML is really fun to learn. I enjoy learning on how to code, making silly webpages, and more. But that is not all. HTML has a lot of amazing features to learn about, and i will discuss it here in this reflection. </p>
    <br>
    <p> My understanding about HTML is that it stands for Hypertext Markup Language and it is used to create webpages. A lot of freelancers create webpages for their clients using HTML. I learned that elements are the building blocks of HTML pages, and that the attributes provide additional information about the elements. I also learned that tags are used to represent the root of an HTML document, like the Br tag for example. Br tags are used to break lines. And lastly, DOCTYPE is used to declare the document type. These are the things that I have learned and understood about HTML. </p>
    <br>
    <p> In conclussion, I have learned a few parts about HTML and understood its uses. I know that it is not a lot, but i am still willing to learn more about HTML to master it and use my undeerstanding for futurte purposes. I really enjoy using HTML. That is all, Thank you!</p>
