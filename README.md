  <body>
    <p> HTML is really fun to learn. I enjoy learning on how to code, making silly webpages, and more. But that is not all. HTML has a lot of amazing features to learn about, and i will discuss it here in this reflection. </p>
    <br>
    <p> My understanding about HTML is that it stands for Hypertext Markup Language and it is used to create webpages. A lot of freelancers create webpages for their clients using HTML. </p>
